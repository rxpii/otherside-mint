# Setup

You'll first need to install nodejs [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

Then, go into your command line console and open up this
directory.

Run the following to install dependencies
```bash
npm i
```

Setup some secrets configuration in `.env`. You'll need the
private keys of your trigger wallet, which is the one that
holds the initial funds (ETH + APE), and your kyc wallet.
You'll also need to specify your RPC provider url too.

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install foobar.


## Usage

```python
import foobar

# returns 'words'
foobar.pluralize('word')

# returns 'geese'
foobar.pluralize('goose')

# returns 'phenomenon'
foobar.singularize('phenomena')
```
